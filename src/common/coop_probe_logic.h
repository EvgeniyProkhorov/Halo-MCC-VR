// --- Co-op drop probe -------------------------------------------------------
// MCC campaign co-op runs a synchronised simulation across both machines, and
// this mod submits the whole VR frame INSIDE MCC's own Present, on MCC's own
// render thread. If that hold makes one machine chronically late, the shared
// session can collapse -- and a co-op collapse takes BOTH players to the menu,
// which is exactly the reported symptom.
//
// This header is the pure, testable half: the per-frame record and the
// reduction that turns a ring of them into one line per second. Nothing here
// touches the engine, D3D or OpenXR, so the maths is unit-tested directly.

// One frame of evidence. "hold" is the time the MOD adds inside Present -- the
// whole hook minus the game's own DXGI call -- because that, not the total, is
// the delay we impose on the thread MCC paces its simulation from.

    float dxgiMs = 0.0f;      // the game's own Present call
    float intervalMs = 0.0f;  // wall time since the previous frame's hook entry
};

// One second of frames, reduced. Deliberately average / maximum / over-threshold
// counts and no percentile: a percentile needs a sort, and a sort of thousands
// of samples is not something to run while the game's render thread is live.

// Reduce `count` samples into one-second buckets relative to `dumpTickMs`.
//
// IMPORTANT: buckets are indexed by AGE -- out[0] is the second immediately
// before the dump, out[1] the second before that, and so on. The caller walks
// the result backwards to print oldest-first. Samples older than `maxBuckets`
// seconds are dropped. Returns the number of bucket slots that hold frames
// (i.e. highest populated age + 1), so a caller can skip trailing empties.
//
// uint32 tick arithmetic is wrap-safe: the subtraction below is modular, so a
// capture spanning a GetTickCount64 truncation boundary still ages correctly.
